# TODO:

## Code:

* GTE: finish off first few instructions
* Fixed point and repeating sections of GTE instructions need refinement
* CPU Tests
* GTE Tests
* GPU and window interface (opengl and vulkan)
* MDEC needs finishing
* DMA needs testing
* Method of loading data from ROMs/CDs
* Interrupts
* Controllers: both control system and maps to hardware devices

## Project Management
* Internally: Some sort of error system. (e.g. memory addresses)
* Sorting out graphics APIs and locations
* CMAKE!! Get cmake working for the project. This is crucial for linking with graphics libs


CPU needs to be tested in depth: the testbench is written and tests can be written too!


# DONE:

* Memory base
* Registers
* CPU
* CPU testbench
* GTE instructions and flags
* Fixed point for GTE
* GTE testbench
* DMA base
