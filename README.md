# TODO:

* GTE instructions
* Fixed point needs (minor) refinement
* CPU Tests
* GTE Tests (will write with instructions)
* GPU and window interface
* MDEC needs finishing
* DMA needs testing
* Method of loading data from ROMs/CDs
* Interrupts
* Controllers: both control system and maps to hardware devices

* Internally: Some sort of error system. (e.g. memory addresses)

CPU needs to be tested in depth: the testbench is written and tests can be written too! Don't be afraid to write tests


# DONE:

* Memory base
* Registers
* CPU
* CPU testbench
* GTE base
* Fixed point for GTE
* GTE testbench
* DMA base
